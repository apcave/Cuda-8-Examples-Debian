# Cuda-8-Examples-Debian
Debian has Nvidia CUDA 8 packages although the examples are missing, this repository provide the examples and will compile on Debian.
This is a redistribution of the Nvidia CUDA 8 examples with a script files that alters the Makefiles so it will compile on Debian with the Aamd64 kernel.
All that is required is the nvidia-cuda-toolkit package and the usual development packages.
The GLES screen examples do not compile as they are target to windows although the OpenGL examples do.
